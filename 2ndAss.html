   <h2 style="font-size: 170%;"> Career growth and development</h2>
   <p style="font-size:140%;">
       Working in tech also offers several 
       opportunities for career growth 
       and skill development.

     You can refine your skills and improve your workflow with every 
      task by applying your knowledge to practical experiences. The 
      skills you learn and apply are transferrable, and they can increase 
      your marketability and advance your career by appealing to 
      potential employers. <br><br>
      You can also consider applying them independently to create 
      your own startup business.

  <p style="font-size:140%; color:darkslategray"> 
    Many brands operate a relaxed dress policy (we do at Ciphr for 
    office-based staff). You don’t need to come to work every day in 
    a 3 piece suit, just spruce yourself up a bit with a casual shirt and 
    trousers.<br>
    The same goes for footwear, scruffy two year old trainers can be 
    replaced with a pair of casual shoes.
  </p>  

  <h3 style="font-size:130%;">Get	social	on	and	offline</h3>
  <p style="font-size:140%; color:darkslategray">Getting to know your colleagues socially is a great way to learn 
     how people tick, but also to strike up new friendships.
    It’s often the case that people will work better together if they 
    socialise as well. Connecting with colleagues on social media 
    helps you and them to bond and become more cohesive as a 
    team.
  </p>
  <h3 style="font-size:130%;">Be	proactive	and	‘give	it	a	go’ </h3>
  <p style="font-size:118%;">Pushing	yourself	and	getting	out	of	your	comfort	zone’s	a	good	way	to	learn	
 	 skills	and	become	more	confident.	Speaking	at	the	company	meeting,	
    attending	customer	events or	meeting	clients	in	person,	whatever	it	is,	offer	
    your	services	and	don’t	wait	to	be	asked,	people	will	notice	your	pro-active	
    nature.<br><br>
    Offering	yourself	up	for	new	challenges	will	also	add	variety	into	your	daily	
    schedule,	stimulating	your	creativity	and	giving	you	a	break	from	the	regular	
    routine.

  <p style="font-size:140%; color:darkslategray">
    When you connect with others that share similar interests in the 
    tech industry, you're building your professional network.<br> 
    Attending local conferences, contributing to online tech forums 
    and talking to local professionals are all effective methods to 
    expand your tech industry connections
